## Setting Up the Project with Docker

You can easily set up the project containers for both development and production environments using Docker Compose.

### Development Environment

To start the development environment, run:

```sh
docker compose -p smartpocket-dev -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Production Environment

To start the production environment, run:

```sh
docker compose -p smartpocket-prod -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Both commands will build and start the containers in detached mode (`-d`). Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
